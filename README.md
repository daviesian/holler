# holler

A very brief introduction to clojure and overtone.

## Usage

Best used with emacs-live.

Open up src/holler/core.clj, then in emacs:

M-x nrepl-jack-in

Evaluate the forms one by one, following the comments.

Note that this project also uses clojurescript, see src-cljs/holler.cljs

If you want to recompile the clojurescript, use lein cljsbuild auto
